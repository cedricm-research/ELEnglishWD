# Survey

This repository contains all code used to generate the statistics and plots in the paper 
**Survey on English Entity Linking on Wikidata**. \
Additionally, the generated statistics and plots are available. 

To generate the statistics again, one has to download the necessary datasets.
Also, the code does not necessarily run out of the box. Sometimes, small adjustments to the code have to be made.
To repeat the ES-Index EL tests, one has to set up an ES instance. There exist functions to populate the index,
but they are undocumented (as nearly everything).
